# EtherealValidator
EtherealValidator is a lightweight .NET library designed to help you quickly validate common data formats such as emails, phone numbers, passwords, URLs, JSON, and XML. The library uses regular expressions and built-in .NET functionality to provide simple methods for performing data validation in your projects.

Features
Email Validation: Validates if an email address follows the correct format.
Phone Number Validation: Validates if a phone number is in a correct international format.
Password Strength Validation: Validates if a password meets security criteria (at least one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character).
URL Validation: Validates if a URL is in a correct format.
JSON Validation: Validates if a string is a valid JSON format.
XML Validation: Validates if a string is a valid XML format.
Cache Support: For email validation, previously validated emails are cached to avoid redundant checks.
